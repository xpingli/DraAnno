\description{
DraAnno.edgeR takes 2 argument: the name of the edgeR processed csv file(containing "logFC","logCPM","LR","PValue","FDR" variables), and in second argument, select "up" and "down" to get either up regulation or down regulation (cutoff parameters are fixed at FDR < 0.05, logFC <= -1 or >=1).
